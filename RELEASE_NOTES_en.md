# Release Notes

## Update Rules (Template)

Reference checklist: `reports/anishi1222/multi-agent-code-reviewer/documentation_sync_checklist_2026-02-17.md`

1. Add a new date section with the same structure in both EN and JA files.
2. Create and push an annotated tag (for example: `vYYYY.MM.DD-notes`).
3. Publish a GitHub Release from the tag and include EN/JA summary notes.
4. Update `README_en.md` and `README_ja.md` with release references and URLs.

## 2026-02-19 Daily Rollup

### Executive Summary

- v2: Java 25 policy alignment in CodeQL workflow (JDK 26 → 25).
- v3: Reliability hardening for idle-timeout scheduler shutdown/rejection path.
- v4: Operational completion checklist synchronization (2026-02-19 baseline, PR #76 traceability).
- v5: Concise operations summary line added to README EN/JA for v2-v4 handoff context.

## 2026-02-19 (v8)

### Summary
- Aligned executive summary output naming with the report-file naming policy.
- Replaced timestamped executive summary output filename with fixed `executive-summary.md`.
- Updated related test stub and README EN/JA output examples for naming consistency.

### Highlights

#### PR #90: Executive Summary Filename Alignment
- `SummaryGenerator` now writes the executive summary file as `executive-summary.md`.
- Updated `ReviewRunExecutorTest` stubbed summary path to `executive-summary.md`.
- Updated output examples in `README_en.md` and `README_ja.md` to match the new naming rule.

### Validation
- PR #90 required checks passed: `CI/Build Native Image`, `CI/Build and Test`, `CI/Supply Chain Guard`, `Dependency Review`, `Automatic Dependency Submission`

## 2026-02-19 (v7)

### Summary
- Followed up the latest security report with targeted remediations and documentation synchronization.
- Synchronized fallback sensitive file patterns in `LocalFileConfig` with resource defaults to keep secret-file filtering safe even on fallback paths.
- Added an opt-in OWASP dependency audit profile and refreshed README EN/JA (including architecture diagram and project structure sync note).

### Highlights

#### Sensitive Pattern Fallback Consistency
- Updated `FALLBACK_SENSITIVE_FILE_PATTERNS` in `LocalFileConfig` to include generic config filenames already present in `defaults/sensitive-file-patterns.txt`:
  - `application.yml`, `application.yaml`
  - `config.json`, `settings.json`, `settings.yaml`
- This preserves sensitive-file filtering behavior even when resource loading falls back to in-code defaults.

#### Regression Guard
- Added `LocalFileConfigTest#fallbackSensitivePatternsContainResourcePatterns`.
- The test validates that fallback sensitive-pattern definitions always include all resource-defined patterns, preventing future drift.

#### Supply-Chain Audit Operation
- Added Maven property `dependency.check.version` and optional profile `security-audit` in `pom.xml`.
- Running `mvn -Psecurity-audit verify` enables OWASP `dependency-check-maven` without making every default build heavier.

#### Documentation Synchronization
- Updated `README_en.md` and `README_ja.md` to record v7 remediation.
- Updated architecture diagram to include `CopilotClientStarter` and `CopilotCliHealthChecker` relations.
- Updated project structure section note to indicate synchronization with the current source layout.

### Validation
- Full test suite passed locally: 971 tests, 0 failures.

## 2026-02-16

### Summary
- Continued the large-class decomposition track and completed modular splits across CLI, target collection, orchestrator, report pipeline, and Copilot startup flow.
- Preserved behavior while reducing command/service class responsibility density and improving testability through focused collaborators.
- Verified full regression safety after the latest `CopilotClientStarter` extraction.

### Highlights
- CLI refactoring:
  - `ReviewCommand` now delegates parsing/resolution/preparation/request-build/execution to dedicated classes.
  - `SkillCommand` now delegates parsing/preparation/execution/output formatting to dedicated classes.
  - Explicitly rejects direct token values for `--token` (stdin/env based flow only).
- Local source collection refactoring:
  - `LocalFileProvider` responsibilities split into candidate collection, candidate processing, content formatting, and normalized selection config.
- Orchestrator/report refactoring:
  - Added dedicated execution/result pipeline/context/precompute components in orchestrator.
  - Split report/summary internals into parser/formatter/builder helpers.
- Copilot startup refactoring:
  - `CopilotService` now delegates CLI path resolution, health checks, timeout resolution, startup error formatting, and startup execution to dedicated components.
  - Added `CopilotClientStarter` to isolate start-time timeout/cause mapping and safe close behavior.

### Validation
- Focused tests: 101 run, 0 failures, 0 errors
- Full test suite: 760 run, 0 failures, 0 errors

## 2026-02-15 (v0.03)

### Summary
- Added multi-pass review capability allowing each agent to perform multiple review passes and merge results into a single report.
- Applied additional fixes for all review findings (High / Medium / Low) and strengthened test coverage.
- Improved CI workflow dependencies and added default configuration values for stability.

### Highlights

#### New Feature: Multi-Pass Review
- Each agent now performs `review-passes` iterations (default: 1), with results merged by `ReviewResultMerger`.
- All passes are submitted concurrently to a Virtual Thread pool, governed by `Semaphore(parallelism)` for concurrency control.
- Merge is string-concatenation only (no additional AI calls).
- Configurable via `reviewer.execution.review-passes` in `application.yml`.

#### Security Hardening
- Strengthened path validation in `ReviewTarget`.
- Added CLI path safety checks in `CliPathResolver`.
- Expanded prompt-injection detection and normalization in `CustomInstructionSafetyValidator`.
- Improved MCP header masking behavior in `GithubMcpConfig`.

#### Performance & Stability
- Improved retry behavior and timeout handling in `ReviewAgent`.
- Enhanced startup cleanup and summary fallback quality in `ReviewOrchestrator`.
- Added per-agent duplicate finding elimination in `ReviewResultMerger`.
- Refactored local file collection logic in `LocalFileProvider` for efficiency.
- Improved retry and error handling in `CopilotService`.

#### Configuration
- Added `AgentPathConfig` to externalize agent path settings.
- Added default values and `@Nullable` annotations to `LocalFileConfig`.
- Added default `reviewer.local-files` settings in `application.yml`.

#### Testing
- Added `ReviewResultMergerTest` (9 test cases).
- Added/expanded `AgentPathConfigTest`, `LocalFileConfigTest`, `ReviewTargetTest`, `LocalFileProviderTest`, `CommandExecutorTest`, `CliPathResolverTest`.
- Total tests: 453 (0 failures, 0 errors).

#### Documentation
- Updated README (EN/JA) with multi-pass review feature description, configuration examples, and architecture diagram.
