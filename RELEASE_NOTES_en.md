## 2026-02-16

### Summary
- Continued the large-class decomposition track and completed modular splits across CLI, target collection, orchestrator, report pipeline, and Copilot startup flow.
- Preserved behavior while reducing command/service class responsibility density and improving testability through focused collaborators.
- Verified full regression safety after the latest `CopilotClientStarter` extraction.

### Highlights
- CLI refactoring:
  - `ReviewCommand` now delegates parsing/resolution/preparation/request-build/execution to dedicated classes.
  - `SkillCommand` now delegates parsing/preparation/execution/output formatting to dedicated classes.
  - Explicitly rejects direct token values for `--token` (stdin/env based flow only).
- Local source collection refactoring:
  - `LocalFileProvider` responsibilities split into candidate collection, candidate processing, content formatting, and normalized selection config.
- Orchestrator/report refactoring:
  - Added dedicated execution/result pipeline/context/precompute components in orchestrator.
  - Split report/summary internals into parser/formatter/builder helpers.
- Copilot startup refactoring:
  - `CopilotService` now delegates CLI path resolution, health checks, timeout resolution, startup error formatting, and startup execution to dedicated components.
  - Added `CopilotClientStarter` to isolate start-time timeout/cause mapping and safe close behavior.

### Validation
- Focused tests: 101 run, 0 failures, 0 errors
- Full test suite: 760 run, 0 failures, 0 errors

## 2026-02-15 (v0.03)

### Summary
- Added multi-pass review capability allowing each agent to perform multiple review passes and merge results into a single report.
- Applied additional fixes for all review findings (High / Medium / Low) and strengthened test coverage.
- Improved CI workflow dependencies and added default configuration values for stability.

### Highlights

#### New Feature: Multi-Pass Review
- Each agent now performs `review-passes` iterations (default: 1), with results merged by `ReviewResultMerger`.
- All passes are submitted concurrently to a Virtual Thread pool, governed by `Semaphore(parallelism)` for concurrency control.
- Merge is string-concatenation only (no additional AI calls).
- Configurable via `reviewer.execution.review-passes` in `application.yml`.

#### Security Hardening
- Strengthened path validation in `ReviewTarget`.
- Added CLI path safety checks in `CliPathResolver`.
- Expanded prompt-injection detection and normalization in `CustomInstructionSafetyValidator`.
- Improved MCP header masking behavior in `GithubMcpConfig`.

#### Performance & Stability
- Improved retry behavior and timeout handling in `ReviewAgent`.
- Enhanced startup cleanup and summary fallback quality in `ReviewOrchestrator`.
- Added per-agent duplicate finding elimination in `ReviewResultMerger`.
- Refactored local file collection logic in `LocalFileProvider` for efficiency.
- Improved retry and error handling in `CopilotService`.

#### Configuration
- Added `AgentPathConfig` to externalize agent path settings.
- Added default values and `@Nullable` annotations to `LocalFileConfig`.
- Added default `reviewer.local-files` settings in `application.yml`.

#### Testing
- Added `ReviewResultMergerTest` (9 test cases).
- Added/expanded `AgentPathConfigTest`, `LocalFileConfigTest`, `ReviewTargetTest`, `LocalFileProviderTest`, `CommandExecutorTest`, `CliPathResolverTest`.
- Total tests: 453 (0 failures, 0 errors).

#### Documentation
- Updated README (EN/JA) with multi-pass review feature description, configuration examples, and architecture diagram.
